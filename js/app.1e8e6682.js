It helps manage memory efficiently.",explanation:"In Java, garbage collection is a mechanism for automatically managing memory by reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. When an object has no references pointing to it, it becomes eligible for garbage collection. The Java garbage collector runs periodically to find and remove such objects, freeing up memory for new objects. Garbage collection helps manage memory efficiently, preventing memory leaks and reducing the need for manual memory management.

This is because an empty substring is considered to be present at every position in the string.",img:""},{question:"Are there any performance considerations when using the indexOf() method with very large strings?",answer:"Yes, the indexOf() method can have performance issues when searching large strings, especially if the target character or substring occurs infrequently or is not found.",explanation:"The indexOf() method searches for a specific character or substring in a string using a linear search, which has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case. When searching very large strings, this can lead to performance issues, especially if the target character or substring occurs infrequently or is not found at all. In such cases, consider using more efficient search algorithms or data structures, such as the Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, or Rabin-Karp algorithms, or a Trie data structure.",img:""},{question:"How do you use the indexOf() method in combination with substring() to extract a portion of a string based on a specific character or substring?",answer:"Find the index of the character or substring using indexOf(), then use substring() with the index to extract the desired portion of the string.",explanation:"To extract a portion of a string based on a specific character or substring, first find the index of the character or substring using the indexOf() method. Then, use the substring() method with the index to extract the desired portion of the string. For example:\n\nString text = \"Hello, world!\";\nint commaIndex = text.indexOf(',');\nString firstPart = text.substring(0, commaIndex);\n\nIn this example, we find the index of the comma character
