    question: "What is a wrapper class in Java?",
    answer: "A class that encapsulates a primitive data type as an object.",
    explanation:
      "A wrapper class in Java is a class that wraps or encapsulates a primitive data type (such as int, char, or float) as an object. Each primitive data type has a corresponding wrapper class, such as Integer for int, Character for char, and Float for float. Wrapper classes allow primitive values to be used in contexts that require objects.",

    question: "What is inheritance in Java?",
    answer:
      "A mechanism for one class to derive properties and methods from another class.",
    explanation:
      "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows one class (the subclass) to inherit properties (instance variables) and methods from another class (the superclass). This promotes code reusability and allows for organizing related classes in a hierarchy.",

  {
    question: "How do you declare inheritance in Java?",
    answer: "Using the extends keyword followed by the superclass name.",
    explanation:
      "To declare inheritance in Java, you use the extends keyword followed by the name of the superclass. This indicates that the class being defined is a subclass of the specified superclass, and it will inherit the properties and methods of that superclass.",

  {
    question: "What is a method in Java?",
    answer:
      "A set of instructions grouped together to perform a specific operation.",
    explanation:
      "A method in Java is a set of instructions grouped together to perform a specific operation or function. Methods are defined within classes and can be called by other methods or objects. They may have input parameters, a return type, and can be associated with access modifiers to control visibility.",

    question: "How do you declare a method in Java?",
    answer:
      "By specifying an access modifier, return type, method name, and parameter list within a class.",
    explanation:
      "To declare a method in Java, you define it within a class, starting with an access modifier (e.g., public, private, protected) followed by the return type (e.g., int, String, or void for no return value), the method name, and a parameter list enclosed in parentheses. The method body is enclosed in curly braces and contains the code to execute when the method is called.",

  {
    question: "What is a parameter in Java?",
    answer: "A value passed to a method when it is called.",
    explanation:
      "A parameter in Java is a value that is passed to a method when it is called. Parameters act as placeholders for the actual values (arguments) that will be provided during the method call. When defining a method, you specify the parameter list with data type and variable name pairs separated by commas. The method can then use these parameters within its body to perform operations.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you pass parameters to a method in Java?",
    answer:
      "By providing arguments in the method call, matching the order and types of the method parameters.",
    explanation:
      "To pass parameters to a method in Java, you provide arguments in the method call, which should match the order and types of the parameters specified in the method definition.

    question: "How do you create an object in Java?",
    answer: "Using the new keyword followed by the constructor call.",
    explanation:
      "To create an object in Java, you use the new keyword followed by a call to the class constructor. This allocates memory for the object and initializes its instance variables. The result is a reference to the newly created object, which can be assigned to a variable of the appropriate type.",

    question: "What is the difference between a class and an object in Java?",
    answer:
      "A class is a blueprint, while an object is an instance of a class.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects of that class. It includes instance variables (data) and methods (behavior). An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class created in memory. Objects have their own state (values of their instance variables) and can perform actions using their methods. Multiple objects can be created from a single class, each with its own state.",

    question: "What is the purpose of the 'this' keyword in Java?",
    answer: "To refer to the current instance of the class.",
    explanation:
      "'this' is a keyword in Java that refers to the current instance of a class. It can be used to access the instance variables and methods of the current object, and is often used to distinguish between instance variables and method parameters with the same name. 'this' can also be used to call other constructors within the same class.",

    answer:
      "A variable that belongs to the class and not any specific instance of the class.",
    explanation:
      "A static variable in Java is a class-level variable that belongs to the class itself rather than any specific instance of the class. It is shared among all instances of the class and is initialized when the class is first loaded. Static variables are often used to store information that should be shared across all instances, such as constants or counters.",

      "The main difference between primitive data types and reference data types in Java is how they store data. Primitive data types (e.g., int, float, boolean, char) store the actual values directly, while reference data types (e.g., classes, interfaces, arrays) store references (memory addresses) to objects. Primitive data types have a fixed memory size and perform faster operations, while reference data types can have varying sizes and require more memory and processing overhead.",
