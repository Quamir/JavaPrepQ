    question: "What is an interface in Java?",
    answer:
      "An interface in Java is a blueprint for a group of related methods without any implementations.",
    explanation:
      "Interfaces in Java define a set of methods that a class must implement without specifying how those methods are implemented. This allows for greater flexibility and abstraction in programming, and can make code easier to maintain and extend over time.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do interfaces differ from classes in Java?",
    answer:
      "Interfaces in Java differ from classes in that they cannot be instantiated, they have no constructors, and they cannot define any implementation code for their methods.",
    explanation:
      "While classes in Java can be instantiated, interfaces cannot. They simply define a set of method signatures that implementing classes must provide. Additionally, while classes can have constructors and implementation code, interfaces cannot.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a class implement multiple interfaces in Java?",
    answer: "Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces in Java.",
    explanation:
      "Java allows a class to implement any number of interfaces, which can be useful for implementing multiple behaviors or for adapting to different types of objects or data.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface extend another interface in Java?",
    answer: "Yes, an interface can extend another interface in Java.",
    explanation:
      "Java allows an interface to extend any number of other interfaces, which can be useful for creating more complex interfaces that inherit and combine behaviors from multiple sources.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of an interface in Java?",
    answer:
      "The purpose of an interface in Java is to define a set of method signatures that a class must implement without specifying how those methods are implemented.",
    explanation:
      "By defining a set of method signatures that must be implemented by a class, an interface in Java allows for greater flexibility and abstraction in programming. It enables different classes to provide their own implementations for these methods, while still adhering to the same set of rules and signatures defined in the interface.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do interfaces promote code reusability in Java?",
    answer:
      "Interfaces promote code reusability in Java by allowing multiple classes to share the same set of method signatures and behaviors, without having to duplicate code.",
    explanation:
      "By defining a set of method signatures that must be implemented by a class, interfaces in Java enable different classes to provide their own implementations for these methods, while still adhering to the same set of rules and signatures defined in the interface. This promotes code reusability, as multiple classes can implement the same interface and share common behaviors and functionality without duplicating code.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the syntax for defining an interface in Java?",
    answer:
      "The syntax for defining an interface in Java is as follows: \n\npublic interface InterfaceName {\n    // method declarations\n}",
    explanation:
      'The keyword "interface" is used to define an interface in Java, followed by the name of the interface. Inside the interface, the method signatures are declared without any implementation code. Any class that implements this interface must provide its own implementation for these methods.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface have fields in Java?",
    answer:
      "Yes, an interface can have fields in Java, but they must be public, static, and final.",
    explanation:
      "Fields can be defined inside an interface in Java, but they must be public, static, and final. This means that they are constants and cannot be modified once they are defined. Fields can be accessed by any class that implements the interface.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface have constructors in Java?",
    answer: "No, an interface cannot have constructors in Java.",
    explanation:
      "Interfaces in Java define a set of method signatures that must be implemented by a class, but they do not have constructors. This is because interfaces do not have any implementation code or state, and are simply used to define a set of behaviors or actions that implementing classes must provide.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the default access modifier for an interface in Java?",
    answer: "The default access modifier for an interface in Java is public.",
    explanation:
      "If no access modifier is specified for an interface in Java, it is considered public by default. This means that any class can implement the interface, regardless of whether it is in the same package or a different package.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface be public in Java?",
    answer: "Yes, an interface can be public in Java.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, an interface can be declared public, which means that it can be accessed from any other class or package. This is the most common way to declare an interface, as it allows for maximum flexibility and reusability of the interface.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface be private in Java?",
    answer: "No, an interface cannot be private in Java.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, an interface can be declared with the access modifiers public, protected, or the default (package-private) modifier. However, it cannot be declared as private, since this would make it inaccessible to any other classes or interfaces that may implement it.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface be protected in Java?",
    answer: "No, an interface cannot be protected in Java.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, an interface can be declared with the access modifiers public, protected, or the default (package-private) modifier. However, it cannot be declared as protected, since this would make it accessible only to the same package or subclasses, which goes against the concept of interfaces as a means of promoting abstraction and reusability.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface have abstract methods in Java?",
    answer: "Yes, an interface can have abstract methods in Java.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, an interface is essentially a set of method signatures that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. Since the methods are not implemented in the interface itself, they are implicitly abstract. As such, it is common for interfaces to have abstract methods that define the behaviors or actions that implementing classes must provide.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface have static methods in Java?",
    answer: "Yes, an interface can have static methods in Java.",
    explanation:
      'In Java 8 and later versions, interfaces can have static methods, which are declared using the "static" keyword. These methods can be called using the interface name, without the need for an instance of the implementing class.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface have default methods in Java?",
    answer: "Yes, an interface can have default methods in Java.",
    explanation:
      'In Java 8 and later versions, interfaces can have default methods, which are declared using the "default" keyword. These methods provide a default implementation for the interface method, which can be overridden by implementing classes if needed. This feature was introduced to allow interfaces to evolve over time without breaking existing code that implements the interface.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is an abstract class in Java?",
    answer:
      "An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated, but can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods and fields.",
    explanation:
      'An abstract class is similar to an interface in that it cannot be instantiated, but it can contain implementation code for some methods and fields. However, abstract classes are typically used when you want to provide a base class that contains some implementation code, but you want to leave some methods abstract so that they can be implemented by subclasses. Abstract classes are declared using the "abstract" keyword.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do abstract classes differ from interfaces in Java?",
    answer:
      "Abstract classes in Java can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods, whereas interfaces can only contain abstract method signatures. Additionally, a class can only extend one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces.",
    explanation:
      "While both abstract classes and interfaces in Java cannot be instantiated, abstract classes can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods and fields, whereas interfaces can only contain method signatures. Additionally, a class can only extend one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces.",

  {
    question: "Can an abstract class have non-abstract methods in Java?",
    answer: "Yes, an abstract class can have non-abstract methods in Java.",
    explanation:
      "An abstract class in Java can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, which can contain implementation code. This can be useful when you want to provide some common implementation code for all subclasses of the abstract class, but still leave some methods abstract so that they can be implemented by subclasses.",

  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of the default keyword in Java interfaces?",
    answer:
      "The purpose of the default keyword in Java interfaces is to provide a default implementation for an interface method.",
    explanation:
      "In Java 8 and later versions, interfaces can have default methods, which provide a default implementation for the method. The default keyword is used to declare these methods, and any class that implements the interface can choose to override the method with its own implementation, or use the default implementation provided by the interface.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can a default method in an interface be overridden in an implementing class in Java?",
    answer:
      "Yes, a default method in an interface can be overridden in an implementing class in Java.",
    explanation:
      "In Java 8 and later versions, interfaces can have default methods, which provide a default implementation for the method. Any class that implements the interface can choose to override the method with its own implementation, or use the default implementation provided by the interface.

    question: "What is the purpose of the static keyword in Java interfaces?",
    answer:
      "The purpose of the static keyword in Java interfaces is to declare static methods that can be called without an instance of the implementing class.",
    explanation:
      "In Java 8 and later versions, interfaces can have static methods, which are declared using the static keyword. These methods can be called using the interface name, without the need for an instance of the implementing class. This can be useful for providing utility methods or common functionality that does not depend on the state of an object.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface have a main method in Java?",
    answer:
      "Yes, an interface can have a main method in Java, but it cannot be executed.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, an interface can have a main method just like any other class. However, since interfaces cannot be instantiated, the main method in an interface cannot be executed directly. Instead, the main method is typically defined in a class that implements the interface, and is used to launch the application.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an interface have a main method and be executed in Java?",
    answer:
      "No, an interface cannot have a main method and be executed in Java.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, a main method must be defined in a class, and it is used to launch the application. Since interfaces cannot be instantiated, the main method cannot be defined in an interface and executed from there. Instead, the main method is typically defined in a class that implements the interface.",

    question: "Can an interface be instantiated in Java?",
    answer: "No, an interface cannot be instantiated in Java.",
    explanation:
      "An interface in Java is essentially a set of method signatures that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. Since interfaces do not have any implementation code or state, they cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, they are used as a blueprint for creating classes that implement the interface.",

    question: "What is a marker interface in Java?",
    answer:
      "A marker interface in Java is an interface with no methods, used to indicate a special behavior or characteristic of a class that implements the interface.",
    explanation:
      "Marker interfaces in Java are used to provide metadata or marker information about a class, without actually providing any methods or functionality. They are typically used to indicate a special behavior or characteristic of a class, such as being serializable, cloneable, or remote. The presence of the marker interface on a class indicates that it has certain capabilities or properties, which can be used by other parts of the application.",

They are typically used to indicate a special behavior or characteristic of a class, such as being serializable, cloneable, or remote. Regular interfaces, on the other hand, define a set of method signatures that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. This allows for greater flexibility in designing and implementing classes with common behavior.",
