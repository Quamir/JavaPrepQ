    question:
      "What is the difference between declaring and initializing a variable in Java?",
    answer:
      "Declaration defines the data type and name of a variable, while initialization assigns a value to it.",
    explanation:
      "When a variable is declared, its data type and name are specified, but no memory is allocated for the variable. In contrast, initialization allocates memory for the variable and assigns an initial value to it.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is an instance variable in Java?",
    answer:
      "A non-static variable that belongs to an object and holds values specific to each instance of the class.",
    explanation:
      "Instance variables are declared inside a class but outside any method. They store data that is specific to each instance of a class and can have different values for different objects.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you declare and initialize an integer variable in Java?",
    answer: "int variableName = value;",
    explanation:
      'The "int" keyword is used to declare an integer variable, followed by the variable name, an equals sign, and the initial value of the variable. The statement ends with a semicolon.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can instance variables be accessed directly from a static method in Java?",
    answer: "No",
    explanation:
      "Instance variables belong to an object, and a static method belongs to the class itself. To access instance variables from a static method, you need to create an object of the class and access the instance variables through that object.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the scope of an instance variable in Java?",
    answer:
      "The entire class in which it is declared.",
    explanation:
      "Instance variables can be accessed by any method within the class where they are declared. They are not accessible outside the class unless the access modifier (such as public) allows it.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you declare a variable of type String in Java?",
    answer: "String variableName;",
    explanation:
      'To declare a variable of type String, use the "String" keyword followed by the variable name. The statement ends with a semicolon.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are the default values assigned to instance variables in Java?",
    answer: "Numeric types: 0, boolean: false, reference types: null",
    explanation:
      "In Java, the default values for instance variables are 0 for numeric types (such as int, long, float, double), false for boolean, and null for reference types (such as String or custom objects).",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can you declare multiple variables of the same data type in a single line in Java?",
    answer: "Yes",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can declare multiple variables of the same data type in a single line, separated by commas. For example: int a, b, c;",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you declare and initialize a boolean variable in Java?",
    answer: "boolean variableName = value;",
    explanation:
      'To declare and initialize a boolean variable in Java, use the "boolean" keyword followed by the variable name, an equals sign, and the initial value (either "true" or "false"). The statement ends with a semicolon.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What are local variables in Java?",
    answer: "Variables defined within a method, constructor, or block.",
    explanation:
      "Local variables are variables that are declared within a method, constructor, or block. They have a limited scope, and their visibility is restricted to the block in which they are defined.",
    img: "",
  },

  {
    question: "What are class variables in Java?",
    answer: "Static variables within a class.",
    explanation:
      'Class variables are variables that are declared with the "static" keyword within a class, but outside of any method, constructor, or block. They have a single value that is shared among all instances of the class.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between instance variables and local variables?",
    answer:
      "Instance variables are declared within a class, and local variables are declared within a method or block.",
    explanation:
      "Instance variables are variables declared within a class but outside of any method or block. They have a separate value for each instance of the class. Local variables, on the other hand, are declared within a method, constructor, or block and have a limited scope and visibility.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the default value of an uninitialized instance variable of type int?",
    answer: "0",
    explanation:
      "In Java, when an instance variable of type int is not explicitly initialized, it is automatically initialized to its default value, which is 0.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the default value of an uninitialized instance variable of type boolean?",
    answer: "false",
    explanation:
      'In Java, when an instance variable of type boolean is not explicitly initialized, it is automatically initialized to its default value, which is "false".',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the default value of an uninitialized instance variable of type char?",
    answer: "\\u0000",
    explanation:
      "In Java, when an instance variable of type char is not explicitly initialized, it is automatically initialized to its default value, which is the null character (\u0000).",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the scope of a local variable in Java?",
    answer:
      "The block which it is declared.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, the scope of a local variable is limited to the block in which it is declared. The variable is only accessible within that block and goes out of scope when the block execution is completed.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      'What does the "final" keyword do when applied to a variable in Java?',
    answer: "It makes the variable a constant.",
    explanation:
      'When the "final" keyword is applied to a variable in Java, it makes the variable a constant. This means the variable\'s value cannot be changed after it has been initialized.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if you do not initialize an instance variable?",
    answer: "It gets a default value.",
    explanation:
      "If you do not initialize an instance variable, Java automatically assigns a default value based on the data type of the variable. For example, numeric types default to 0, boolean types default to false, and reference types default to null.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      'What is the purpose of the "final" keyword when used with a variable?',
    answer: "It makes the variable's value unmodifiable.",
    explanation:
      'When the "final" keyword is used with a variable, it makes the variable\'s value unmodifiable, meaning it can only be assigned once. This creates a constant variable that cannot be changed after its initial assignment.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What are class variables and how are they declared?",
    answer:
      'Variables shared among all instances of a class and are declared with the "static" keyword.',
    explanation:
      'Class variables are shared among all instances of a class, and only one copy of the variable exists in memory. They are declared using the "static" keyword before the data type. For example: static int counter;',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: 'What does it mean for a variable to be "shadowed"?',
    answer:
      "When a local variable has the same name as an instance variable.",
    explanation:
      'When a local variable has the same name as an instance variable, the local variable is said to "shadow" the instance variable. In this case, the local variable takes precedence within the method, and the instance variable is only accessible using the "this" keyword. For example: this.instanceVariable = localVariable;',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you explicitly initialize an array?",
    answer: "Use curly braces {} and a comma-separated list of values.",
    explanation:
      "To explicitly initialize an array in Java, use curly braces and a comma-separated list of values. For example: int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you initialize an object in Java?",
    answer: 'Use the "new" keyword and call the constructor.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, you initialize an object by using the "new" keyword and calling the constructor of the class. For example: ClassName object = new ClassName();',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of a constructor in Java?",
    answer: "Initializes an object when it is created.",
    explanation:
      "A constructor is a special method in a class that is called when a new instance of the class is created. Constructors are used to initialize the state of an object by setting the values of its instance variables.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between declaring and initializing a variable?",
    answer:
      "Declaring a variable reserves memory for it, while initializing a variable assigns a value to it.",
    explanation:
      "Declaring a variable involves specifying its type and name, which reserves memory for it. Initializing a variable involves assigning a specific value to it. Variables can be declared and initialized at the same time, or they can be declared first and then initialized later in the code.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How can you access an instance variable from a static method?",
    answer:
      "By creating an instance of the class and using it to access the instance variable.",
    explanation:
      "Static methods belong to the class and not to instances of the class. As a result, you cannot directly access instance variables from a static method. To access an instance variable from a static method, you need to create an instance of the class and then use that instance to access the variable.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: 'What does the "this" keyword refer to in Java?',
    answer: "the current instance of a class.",
    explanation:
      'In Java, the "this" keyword refers to the current instance of a class. It can be used to access instance variables and methods within the class. The "this" keyword is often used to resolve naming conflicts between instance variables and local variables or method parameters.',
