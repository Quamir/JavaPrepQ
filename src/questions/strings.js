    question: "What is a String in Java?",
    answer: "A sequence of characters.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, a String is an object that represents a sequence of characters. It is a widely used data type that can store and manipulate textual data.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you create a String in Java?",
    answer: 'Using a String literal or a String object with the "new" keyword.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, you can create a String in two ways: by using a String literal enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "Hello, World!") or by creating a String object using the "new" keyword (e.g., new String("Hello, World!")).',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between a String literal and a String object in Java?",
    answer:
      "String literals are stored in the String pool, while String objects are created on the heap.",
    explanation:
      'In Java, String literals are stored in a special area of memory called the String pool, and multiple references to the same literal share the same memory location. On the other hand, creating a String object with the "new" keyword allocates memory on the heap, and each String object has its own separate memory location.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the meaning of String immutability in Java?",
    answer: "Once created, a String cannot be changed.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, Strings are immutable, which means that once a String object is created, its content cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a String actually creates a new String object with the modified content, leaving the original String unchanged.",

  {
    question: "How do you concatenate Strings in Java?",
    answer: 'Using the "+" operator, concat() method, or StringBuilder.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, you can concatenate Strings using the "+" operator (e.g., "Hello" + " World"), the concat() method (e.g., "Hello".concat(" World")), or the StringBuilder class (e.g., new StringBuilder("Hello").append(" World")).',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between using the '+' operator and StringBuilder for String concatenation in Java?",
    answer:
      'The "+" operator creates a new String, while StringBuilder modifies the existing one.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, using the "+" operator for String concatenation creates a new String object for each concatenation, which can be inefficient for multiple concatenations. StringBuilder, on the other hand, allows you to modify the existing StringBuilder object, making it more efficient for concatenating multiple Strings.',

  {
    question: "How do you compare two Strings for equality in Java?",
    answer: "Using the equals() method.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, to compare two Strings for equality, you should use the equals() method (e.g., string1.equals(string2)). The equals() method compares the content of the Strings character by character, returning true if they are equal and false if they are not.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between the '==' operator and the equals() method for String comparison in Java?",
    answer:
      'The "==" operator compares references, while equals() compares content.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, the "==" operator compares the memory references of two String objects, which may not accurately determine if their content is equal. The equals() method, on the other hand, compares the content of the two Strings character by character, providing an accurate comparison of their content.',
