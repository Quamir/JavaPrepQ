    question: "What is a String in Java?",
    answer: "A sequence of characters.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, a String is an object that represents a sequence of characters. It is a widely used data type that can store and manipulate textual data.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you create a String in Java?",
    answer: 'Using a String literal or a String object with the "new" keyword.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, you can create a String in two ways: by using a String literal enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "Hello, World!") or by creating a String object using the "new" keyword (e.g., new String("Hello, World!")).',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between a String literal and a String object in Java?",
    answer:
      "String literals are stored in the String pool, while String objects are created on the heap.",
    explanation:
      'In Java, String literals are stored in a special area of memory called the String pool, and multiple references to the same literal share the same memory location. On the other hand, creating a String object with the "new" keyword allocates memory on the heap, and each String object has its own separate memory location.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the meaning of String immutability in Java?",
    answer: "Once created, a String cannot be changed.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, Strings are immutable, which means that once a String object is created, its content cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a String actually creates a new String object with the modified content, leaving the original String unchanged.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you concatenate Strings in Java?",
    answer: 'Using the "+" operator, concat() method, or StringBuilder.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, you can concatenate Strings using the "+" operator (e.g., "Hello" + " World"), the concat() method (e.g., "Hello".concat(" World")), or the StringBuilder class (e.g., new StringBuilder("Hello").append(" World")).',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between using the '+' operator and StringBuilder for String concatenation in Java?",
    answer:
      'The "+" operator creates a new String, while StringBuilder modifies the existing one.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, using the "+" operator for String concatenation creates a new String object for each concatenation, which can be inefficient for multiple concatenations. StringBuilder, on the other hand, allows you to modify the existing StringBuilder object, making it more efficient for concatenating multiple Strings.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you compare two Strings for equality in Java?",
    answer: "Using the equals() method.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, to compare two Strings for equality, you should use the equals() method (e.g., string1.equals(string2)). The equals() method compares the content of the Strings character by character, returning true if they are equal and false if they are not.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between the '==' operator and the equals() method for String comparison in Java?",
    answer:
      'The "==" operator compares references, while equals() compares content.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, the "==" operator compares the memory references of two String objects, which may not accurately determine if their content is equal. The equals() method, on the other hand, compares the content of the two Strings character by character, providing an accurate comparison of their content.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you find the length of a String in Java?",
    answer: "Using the length() method.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can find the length of a String by calling the length() method on the String object (e.g., string.length()). The method returns the number of characters in the String.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you convert a String to lowercase or uppercase in Java?",
    answer: "Using toLowerCase() or toUpperCase() methods.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can convert a String to lowercase or uppercase using the toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() methods, respectively (e.g., string.toLowerCase() or string.toUpperCase()). These methods return a new String with all characters converted to the desired case.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you extract a part of a String (substring) in Java?",
    answer: "Using the substring() method.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can extract a part of a String (substring) using the substring() method. The method has two forms: substring(int beginIndex) and substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex). The first form returns a substring starting from the specified index to the end of the String, while the second form returns a substring starting from the specified beginIndex and ending before the endIndex.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you split a String into an array of Strings in Java?",
    answer: "Using the split() method.",
    explanation:
      'In Java, you can split a String into an array of Strings using the split() method. The method takes a regular expression as a parameter (e.g., string.split("s")). The method splits the String at the points where the regular expression matches and returns an array of the resulting substrings.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How do you replace characters or substrings within a String in Java?",
    answer: "Using the replace(), replaceAll(), or replaceFirst() methods.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can replace characters or substrings within a String using the replace(), replaceAll(), or replaceFirst() methods. The replace() method replaces all occurrences of a character or CharSequence with another character or CharSequence. The replaceAll() and replaceFirst() methods replace substrings that match a given regular expression with a replacement string, either for all matches or the first match, respectively.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How do you remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a String in Java?",
    answer: "Using the trim() method.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a String using the trim() method (e.g., string.trim()). The method returns a new String with leading and trailing whitespace characters removed.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you convert a String to a char array in Java?",
    answer: "Using the toCharArray() method.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can convert a String to a char array using the toCharArray() method (e.g., string.toCharArray()). The method returns a new char array containing the characters of the String in the same order.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you convert a char array to a String in Java?",
    answer: "Using the String constructor.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can convert a char array to a String by passing the char array to the String constructor (e.g., new String(charArray)). The constructor creates a new String object containing the characters from the char array in the same order.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How do you find the index of a character or substring within a String in Java?",
    answer: "Using the indexOf() or lastIndexOf() methods.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can find the index of a character or substring within a String using the indexOf() or lastIndexOf() methods. The indexOf() method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified character or substring, while the lastIndexOf() method returns the index of the last occurrence. If the character or substring is not found, both methods return -1.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you iterate over the characters of a String in Java?",
    answer: "Using a for loop, for-each loop, or Java streams.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can iterate over the characters of a String using a for loop, for-each loop, or Java streams. A for loop iterates over the indices of the String and uses the charAt() method to access each character. A for-each loop iterates over the characters by first converting the String to a char array using the toCharArray() method. Java streams can be used with the chars() method to create an IntStream of character codes, which can then be processed using various stream operations.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How do you convert a String to an integer or a floating-point number in Java?",
    answer:
      "Using parseInt(), parseDouble(), or other parse methods from Integer or Double classes.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can convert a String to an integer or a floating-point number using the parseInt(), parseDouble(), or other parse methods from the Integer or Double classes. For example, you can use Integer.parseInt(string) to convert a String to an int, and Double.parseDouble(string) to convert a String to a double. These methods throw a NumberFormatException if the String cannot be parsed as a valid number.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How do you convert an integer or a floating-point number to a String in Java?",
    answer: "Using the toString() method or String.valueOf() method.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, you can convert an integer or a floating-point number to a String using the toString() method or the String.valueOf() method. The toString() method is available in the Integer, Double, and other wrapper classes (e.g., Integer.toString(int) or Double.toString(double)). The String.valueOf() method accepts various data types, including integers and floating-point numbers (e.g., String.valueOf(int) or String.valueOf(double)). Both methods return a new String object representing the numeric value.",
    img: "",

  {
    question:
      "What is the String.format() method in Java, and how do you use it?",
    answer:
      "The String.format() method is used for formatting strings with placeholders.",
    explanation:
      'In Java, the String.format() method is used to create formatted strings by replacing placeholders with specified values. It takes a format string containing placeholders (e.g., %s for strings, %d for integers, %f for floating-point numbers) and a list of arguments that replace the placeholders. The method returns a new formatted String object. For example, String.format("Hello, %s! You have %d messages.", name, messageCount) creates a string with the name and message count inserted at the specified placeholders.',
