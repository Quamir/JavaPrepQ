    question: "What is the purpose of the .equals() method in Java?",
    answer:
      "The .equals() method is used to compare the values of two objects in Java.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, the == operator is used to compare the reference values of two objects, while the .equals() method is used to compare their actual values. This is particularly useful when working with objects that contain complex data types, such as strings or arrays.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How is the .equals() method different from the == operator in Java?",
    answer:
      "The == operator compares the reference values of two objects, while the .equals() method compares their actual values.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, the == operator checks if two objects have the same reference value in memory, while the .equals() method checks if their actual values are the same. This means that two objects with the same values may not be equal if they have different reference values.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is object comparison in Java?",
    answer:
      "Object comparison in Java refers to checking whether two objects are equal.",
    explanation:
      "Object comparison can be performed using the == operator or the .equals() method. The == operator checks whether two object references point to the same object in memory, while the .equals() method checks whether two objects are equal in value.",

  },
  {
    question: "Are comments executable code in Java?",
    answer: "No",
    explanation:
      "Comments are not executed by the Java compiler and do not affect the program's functionality. They are simply used to annotate and explain the code.",
