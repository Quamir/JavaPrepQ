        question: 'How do you declare an array of 5 integers and initialize it with values in Java?',
        answer: 'int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};',
        explanation: 'In Java, you can declare and initialize an array with values by using the following syntax: "dataType[] arrayName = {value1, value2, ...};". In this case, we declare an integer array named "numbers" and initialize it with the values 1 to 5.',

      },
      {
        question: 'Which Java data type can hold only two possible values, true or false?',
        answer: 'boolean',
        explanation: 'The boolean data type is a primitive data type in Java that can hold only two possible values, true or false. It is used to represent the logical values of a condition and is commonly used in control structures like if, while, and for statements.',

      },
      {
        question: 'What type of error occurs when the code violates the syntax rules of a programming language?',
        answer: 'Syntax error',
        explanation: 'A syntax error occurs when the code does not follow the syntax rules of the programming language. These errors usually prevent the code from being compiled or executed and must be fixed before the program can run.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between primitive and reference data types in Java?',
        answer: 'Primitive data types are basic, predefined data types, while reference data types refer to objects in memory.',
        explanation: 'Primitive data types are basic data types that have a fixed size and directly store values, such as int, double, or char. Reference data types, on the other hand, store the memory address of an object, such as classes, interfaces, arrays, or strings. Reference data types can also be assigned null, indicating no object is referenced.',

      },
      {
        question: 'What is the purpose of a switch statement in Java?',
        answer: 'To check multiple conditions against a single expression.',
        explanation: 'A switch statement is used to evaluate a single expression and compare it to various cases. When a case matches the expression, the associated code block is executed. This is useful when you have multiple conditions to check against, as it simplifies the code compared to using multiple if-else statements.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What does the term "short-circuiting" mean in the context of logical operators?',
        answer: 'The evaluation of an expression stops when the result can be determined without evaluating the entire expression.',
        explanation: 'In the case of the && (AND) operator, if the left-hand operand is false, the entire expression will be false, so the right-hand operand is not evaluated. In the case of the || (OR) operator, if the left-hand operand is true, the entire expression will be true, so the right-hand operand is not evaluated. Short-circuiting can improve performance and prevent unnecessary evaluations.',

      },
      {
        question: 'What does it mean when a String is immutable in Java?',
        answer: 'An immutable String cannot be changed after it is created.',
        explanation: 'In Java, Strings are immutable, which means that once a String object is created, its contents cannot be altered. Instead of modifying the original String, you can create a new String by concatenating, substring, or other operations.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the purpose of comments in Java?',
        answer: 'To add explanatory or descriptive text to the source code.',
        explanation: 'Comments provide a way to include explanatory or descriptive text in the source code, helping developers understand the code better. They are ignored by the compiler or interpreter, so they do not affect the program execution. Comments are useful for documenting code, explaining complex logic, or providing context for future developers.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What is a runtime error in Java?',
        answer: 'An error that occurs while a program is running.',
        explanation: 'A runtime error, also called an exception, occurs when a program encounters an unexpected condition that was not handled by the code, such as dividing by zero or accessing an array index out of bounds. When a runtime error occurs, the program stops executing and usually displays an error message. Exception handling techniques can be used to handle runtime errors and prevent the program from crashing.',

      },
      {
        question: 'How do you access the first element of an array in Java?',
        answer: 'arrayName[0]',
        explanation: 'In Java, arrays are zero-indexed, which means the first element of an array is at index 0. To access the first element of an array, you would use the array name followed by the index in square brackets, like this: "arrayName[0]".',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What is a nested conditional statement in Java?',
        answer: 'A conditional statement placed inside another conditional statement.',
        explanation: 'Nested conditional statements allow you to check for multiple conditions before taking a particular action. They provide a way to create more complex decision-making structures by placing if, else-if, or switch statements inside other conditional statements.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between the "==" operator and the ".equals()" method in Java?',
        answer: 'The "==" operator compares memory addresses, while the ".equals()" method compares object contents.',
        explanation: 'The "==" operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory, comparing their memory addresses. The ".equals()" method, on the other hand, checks if two objects have the same contents, regardless of their memory addresses. This is particularly important when comparing objects like Strings, where the contents of the objects are more relevant than their memory addresses.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the purpose of the boolean data type in Java?',
        answer: 'To represent logical values of true or false.',
        explanation: 'The boolean data type is used to represent logical values, true or false. It is commonly used in control structures like if, while, and for statements to control program flow based on conditions, and in complex logical expressions combined with logical operators like &&, ||, and !.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you declare and initialize an array in Java with specific values?',
        answer: 'Using the format: dataType[] arrayName = {value1, value2, value3};',
        explanation: 'To declare and initialize an array in Java with specific values, you can use the following syntax: dataType[] arrayName = {value1, value2, value3}; This creates an array of the specified data type with the given values. The size of the array is determined by the number of values provided.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What are the two types of comments in Java?',
        answer: 'Single-line comments and multi-line comments.',
        explanation: 'Single-line comments begin with two forward slashes (//) and continue until the end of the line, typically used for short, descriptive comments. Multi-line comments begin with a forward slash and an asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk and a forward slash (*/), allowing the comment to span across multiple lines, typically used for longer comments or commenting out blocks of code.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between a syntax error and a logical error in Java?',
        answer: 'A syntax error violates language rules, while a logical error produces unexpected output.',
        explanation: 'A syntax error occurs when the code violates the language \'s syntax rules, usually preventing the code from being compiled or executed. A logical error, on the other hand, occurs when the code runs without throwing any errors, but the output is not what was expected, usually due to a mistake in the program\'s logic.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you create a new String object in Java?',
        answer: 'Using the "new" keyword or by assigning a string literal to a variable.',
        explanation: 'You can create a new String object in Java by using the "new" keyword followed by the String class constructor or by simply assigning a string literal to a variable. For example: String s1 = new String("Hello, World"); or String s2 = "Hello, World"; Both create a new String object with the value "Hello, World".',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What are the four JavaDoc tags commonly used to document methods?',
        answer: '@param, @return, @throws, and @author.',
        explanation: '@param is used to document a method\'s parameters, providing information about the data type and purpose of each parameter. @return is used to document a method\'s return value, providing information about the data type and meaning of the value. @throws is used to document the exceptions a method can throw. @author is used to document the author of a class or method.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the purpose of the "!=" operator in Java?',
        answer: 'To compare two values and return true if they are not equal.',
        explanation: 'The "!=" operator is a comparison operator in Java used to check if two values are not equal. It returns true if the values are not equal, and false otherwise. This operator can be used with both primitive data types and reference data types to check for inequality.',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'How can you access the first element of an array in Java?',
        answer: 'Using arrayName[0].',
        explanation: 'In Java, arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0. To access the first element of an array, you can use the array name followed by the index enclosed in square brackets: arrayName[0].',
        img: ''
      },
      {
        question: 'What is short-circuiting in Java?',
        answer: 'A behavior in logical operators where the result is determined without evaluating the entire expression.',
        explanation: 'Short-circuiting occurs in logical operators (&& and ||) when the result of an expression can be determined without evaluating the entire expression. For the && operator, if the left-hand operand is false, the entire expression is false. For the || operator, if the left-hand operand is true, the entire expression is true. This behavior can be useful for optimizing performance and avoiding unnecessary computations.',

      },
      {
        question: 'What does it mean for a String to be immutable in Java?',
        answer: 'Once a String object is created, its contents cannot be changed.',
        explanation: 'In Java, Strings are immutable, meaning that once a String object is created, its contents cannot be changed. However, you can create new strings by concatenating existing strings with the "+" operator. This immutability is beneficial for performance and security reasons, as well as making it easier to reason about the behavior of the code.',
