    question: "What is a strictly typed programming language?",
    answer:
      "A programming language in which variables must be declared with their data type before they can be assigned a value.",
    explanation:
      "In a strictly typed programming language, the data type of a variable must be specified before it can be used. This helps to catch errors at compile-time, before the program is executed.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What are some examples of strictly typed programming languages?",
    answer: "Java, C++, C#, Swift",
    explanation:
      "Strictly typed programming languages include Java, C++, C#, Swift, and others. In these languages, variables must be declared with their data type before they can be used, which helps to prevent errors at compile-time.",

  {
    question:
      "What is the advantage of using a strictly typed programming language?",
    answer: "Early detection of errors and easier maintenance of code",
    explanation:
      "By catching errors at compile-time, strict typing helps to ensure that code is error-free and runs smoothly. This makes it easier to maintain and modify code over time.",

  {
    question:
      "What is the disadvantage of using a strictly typed programming language?",
    answer: "Less flexibility and more verbose code",
    explanation:
      "Strict typing can make code more verbose and less flexible, which can be a disadvantage in certain situations. For example, dynamically typed languages like Python allow for more flexible and concise code.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can you change the data type of a variable in a strictly typed programming language?",
    answer:
      "No, the data type of a variable must be declared and cannot be changed later.",
    explanation:
      "In a strictly typed programming language, the data type of a variable must be declared before it can be used, and cannot be changed later. This helps to prevent errors and ensures that the code is well-defined.",
