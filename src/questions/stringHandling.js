  {
    question: "Why does the String class in Java have private final fields?",
    answer:
      "The String class in Java has private final fields to enforce immutability and encapsulation.",
    explanation:
      "The private final fields in the String class ensure that the contents of a string object cannot be changed after it is created. This enforces the immutability of strings in Java. Additionally, by making the fields private, the String class encapsulates its internal state, preventing external code from accessing or modifying the fields directly.",

    question:
      'Why is it not recommended to use the "==" operator for comparing strings in Java?',
    answer:
      'The "==" operator compares object references, not the content of the strings.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, the "==" operator compares the memory addresses of the two objects, not their contents. When comparing strings, this can lead to unexpected results, as two strings with the same content might have different memory addresses. To compare the content of strings, it is recommended to use the equals() method, which compares the characters in the strings to determine if they are equal.',
