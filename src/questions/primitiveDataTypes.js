    question: "What is the smallest integer data type in Java?",
    answer: "byte",
    explanation:

    question:
      "What is the difference between float and double data types in Java?",
    answer:
      "Float is a single-precision floating-point, while double is a double-precision floating-point.",
    explanation:
      "The main difference between float and double data types in Java is their precision. Float uses 32 bits of memory and has a single-precision, while double uses 64 bits of memory and has a double-precision. As a result, double data types can store larger numbers with higher precision than float data types.",
