    question: "What is the boolean data type in Java?",
    answer:
      "A primitive data type that represents true or false values.",
    explanation:
      "The boolean data type is used to represent true or false values in Java. It is a primitive data type and can be used in conditional expressions and control structures like if, while, and for loops. Booleans are typically used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.",

    question: "How do you declare a boolean variable in Java?",
    answer:
      'Use the keyword "boolean" followed by the variable name.',
    explanation:
      'In Java, you declare a boolean variable by using the keyword "boolean" followed by the variable name. For example, to declare a boolean variable named "isTrue", you would write: "boolean isTrue;". You can also initialize the variable at the time of declaration, like this: "boolean isTrue = false;".',

    question: "What is the purpose of an if statement in Java?",
    answer:
      "To execute a block of code only if a specific condition is true.",
    explanation:
      "An if statement in Java is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code only if a specific condition evaluates to true. If the condition is false, the block of code within the if statement is skipped, and the program continues executing the code after the if statement.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you write a for loop in Java?",
    answer:
      'Use the syntax "for (initialization; condition; increment) { // code to be executed }".',
    explanation:
      'In Java, a for loop is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code a specific number of times. The loop consists of three parts: the initialization, where you set the initial value of a loop control variable; the condition, which is checked before each iteration and determines whether the loop should continue; and the increment, which updates the loop control variable after each iteration. The syntax for a for loop is: "for (initialization; condition; increment) { // code to be executed }".',

    question:
      "What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop in Java?",
    answer:
      "The difference between a while loop and a do-while loop in Java is that a while loop checks the condition before executing the loop body, while a do-while loop checks the condition after executing the loop body.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, a while loop checks the condition before executing the loop body, and if the condition is false, the loop body is never executed. In contrast, a do-while loop always executes the loop body at least once, because the condition is checked after the loop body has been executed.",

  {
    question: "What is the purpose of a break statement in Java?",
    answer:
      "The purpose of a break statement in Java is to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely.",
    explanation:
      "A break statement in Java is used to exit a loop or switch statement before its natural termination point. When a break statement is encountered, the control flow jumps out of the loop or switch block and continues executing the code that follows the block.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of a continue statement in Java?",
    answer:
      "To skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and start the next iteration.",
    explanation:
      "A continue statement in Java is used within a loop (for, while, or do-while) to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and start the next iteration of the loop. The loop control variable is updated, and the loop condition is checked before starting the next iteration.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How can you use an if-else statement to check for multiple conditions in Java?",
    answer:
      "In Java, you can use an if-else statement with multiple else-if blocks to check for multiple conditions.",
    explanation:
      'To check for multiple conditions in Java, you can use an if-else statement with multiple else-if blocks. Each else-if block checks a different condition, and the code within the corresponding block is executed if the condition is true. If none of the conditions are true, the code within the else block is executed. The syntax looks like this: "if (condition1) { // code } else if (condition2) { // code } else { // code }".',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a nested loop in Java?",
    answer:
      "A loop that is placed inside another loop.",
    explanation:
      "A nested loop in Java refers to a situation where a loop is placed inside another loop. The inner loop completes all its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop. Nested loops are often used when working with multidimensional arrays or when a specific combination of values needs to be generated.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you use a while loop in Java?",
    answer:
      "By providing a condition that is checked before each iteration of the loop.",
    explanation:
      'A while loop in Java is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the given condition is true. The syntax for a while loop is "while (condition) { // code }". The loop will continue to execute the code inside the curly braces until the condition becomes false.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a do-while loop in Java?",
    answer:
      "A do-while loop is a control structure in Java that executes a block of code at least once and then continues executing it as long as a given condition remains true.",
    explanation:
      'A do-while loop in Java is similar to a while loop, but the main difference is that the code inside the loop is executed at least once, even if the condition is false from the start. The syntax for a do-while loop is "do { // code } while (condition);". The loop will continue to execute the code inside the curly braces until the condition becomes false.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of a for loop in Java?",
    answer:
      "To execute a block of code a specific number of times or for each element in a collection or array.",
    explanation:
      'A for loop in Java is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code a specific number of times, or for each element in a collection or array. The for loop has three parts: an initialization, a condition, and an update, which are separated by semicolons. The syntax for a for loop is "for (initialization; condition; update) { // code }". The loop will execute the code inside the curly braces as long as the condition is true, and the update statement is executed after each iteration.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you use a for-each loop in Java?",
    answer:
      "To iterate through each element in a collection or array without needing to know the size or index of the elements.",
    explanation:
      'A for-each loop in Java, also known as an enhanced for loop, is a simpler way to iterate through each element in a collection or array without the need for an index or knowing the size of the collection. The syntax for a for-each loop is "for (elementType element : collection) { // code }". The loop automatically iterates through each element in the collection, and the element variable takes on the value of the current element in each iteration.',
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between the && and || operators in Java?",
    answer:
      "In Java, the && operator is a logical AND operator, while the || operator is a logical OR operator.",
    explanation:
      "In Java, the && operator is a logical AND operator that returns true only if both operands are true, and false otherwise. The || operator is a logical OR operator that returns true if at least one of the operands is true, and false if both operands are false. Both operators are used in control structures, like if statements and loops, to combine multiple conditions.",

  },
  {
    question: "What is the syntax for a while loop in Java?",
    answer: "while (condition) { // code to be executed }",
    explanation:
      "The while loop in Java is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as the given condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the code block is executed. If it is false, the loop terminates and control passes to the next statement in the program.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the syntax for a do-while loop in Java?",
    answer: "do { // code to be executed } while (condition);",
    explanation:
      "The do-while loop in Java is similar to the while loop, but with one key difference: the condition is checked at the end of the loop rather than at the beginning. This means that the code block is always executed at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.",
    img: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the syntax for a for loop in Java?",
    answer:
      "for (initialization; condition; update) { // code to be executed }",
    explanation:
      "The for loop in Java is used to execute a block of code a fixed number of times. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and update. The initialization statement is executed once at the beginning of the loop. The condition is checked before each iteration of the loop. If it is true, the code block is executed. After the code block has executed, the update statement is executed. The condition is checked again, and the loop continues as long as it remains true.",

    answer: "if (condition) { // code to be executed }",
    explanation:
      "The if statement in Java is used to execute a block of code if a given condition is true. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped and control passes to the next statement in the program. If the condition is true, the code block is executed.",

    question: "What is the syntax for an if-else statement in Java?",
    answer:
      "if (condition) { // code to be executed if condition is true } else { // code to be executed if condition is false }",
    explanation:
      "The if-else statement in Java is used to execute one block of code if a given condition is true, and another block of code if it is false. If the condition is true, the first code block is executed. If it is false, the second code block is executed.",

    question: "What is the syntax for a basic if statement in Java?",
    answer: "if (condition) {\n // code block\n}",
    explanation:
